# Overview

I wrote two functions alongside formatting for the first function for display purposes.

To expand my opinion and experience with functional programming. Up until this point I was constrained by only having experience with Clojure which was explained in a way that was poorly concieved.

# Development Environment

I used the native Erlang language console which is effectively a focused console/powershell

I made a module in Erlang named memes that had fibonacci functions held within. I called the file using pathing in the Erlang Console app
